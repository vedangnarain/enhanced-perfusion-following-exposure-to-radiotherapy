# Enhanced perfusion following exposure to radiotherapy: a theoretical investigation

Code used to generate simulations and figures for the submitted paper 'Enhanced perfusion following exposure to radiotherapy: a theoretical investigation' (2023).

Simulations were generated using [Microvessel Chaste](https://jmsgrogan.github.io/MicrovesselChaste/), an add-on to [Chaste](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/). For installation instructions and the modified source code, see [this page](https://github.com/vedangnarain/MicrovesselChaste).

TDA metrics are generated by _Script.py_, while _calculate_nonrandom_forking_metrics_individual_killing.py_ is used to generate the geometric metrics.
