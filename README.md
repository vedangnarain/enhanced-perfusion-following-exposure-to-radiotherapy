# Enhanced perfusion following exposure to radiotherapy: a theoretical investigation

An archive of code used to generate simulations and figures for the submitted paper 'Enhanced perfusion following exposure to radiotherapy: a theoretical investigation' (2023).

Simulations were generated using [Microvessel Chaste](https://jmsgrogan.github.io/MicrovesselChaste/), an add-on to [Chaste](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/). For installation instructions and the modified source code, see [this page](https://github.com/vedangnarain/MicrovesselChaste).

## Key Scripts

The Python files used to analyse the simulation data and produce figures can be found in the directory `Scripts`. 

- Geometric metrics for the forking network are generated by `calculate_nonrandom_forking_metrics_individual_killing.py`
- Geometric metrics for the hexagonal network are generated by `calculate_hex_metrics_individual_killing` 
- TDA metrics are generated by `TDA/Script.py`
- Diameter distributions for the hexagonal network are generated by `generate_hexagonal_radii_distributions.py`
